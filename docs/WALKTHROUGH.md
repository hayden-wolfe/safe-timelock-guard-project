## 0. Rubric scoreboard (where points come from)

| Section | Pts | Where it's earned in this plan |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Technical Implementation & Contribution Quality | 25 | Week 2 implementation + tests |
| 2. Engagement with Open Source Project | 15 | Issue comment in Week 1, draft PR in Week 3 |
| 3. Evaluation & Validation | 15 | Tests + gas benchmarks + Sepolia deploy in Weeks 2–3 |
| 4. Final Report | 15 | Drafted across all weeks, finalized Week 3 |
| 5. GitHub Activity & Repo Organization | 10 | **Frequent commits across all 3 weeks** + clean README |
| 6. Team Collaboration & Contribution | 5 | Solo: write a clear scope/effort statement in the report |
| 7. Self-Recorded Video | 5 | Recorded Week 3 |
| **Total** | **90** | |

**The single biggest mistake to avoid:** dumping all commits at the end. Commit *something* at least every couple of days, even if it's docs or design notes. The "progressive work" criterion (6 pts) is binary in practice.

## Week 1 — Understand & design (current week)

**Outcome:** A finalized design document, a working dev environment, and the first comment posted on Issue #1065 to flag intent.

### Day 1 — Setup ✅ (largely done by this walkthrough)

- [x] Clone `safe-fndn/safe-smart-account` locally.
- [x] Read Issue #1065 and the OpenZeppelin `TimelockController` for reference.
- [x] Read `Safe.sol::execTransaction` flow and `ITransactionGuard` interface.
- [x] Read existing example guards (`OnlyOwnersGuard`, `DelegateCallTransactionGuard`, `BaseGuard`).
- [x] `npm install` and run a single guard test as a smoke test.
- [x] Draft `DESIGN.md`.
- [ ] **Create your own GitHub repo** (e.g. `hwolfe1209/timelock-guard`) for the project deliverables. This is the URL that goes at the top of your final report.
- [ ] **Sign the Safe CLA** at https://safe.global/cla — required before any PR is merged. Do this now so it's not a Week 3 blocker.
- [ ] **Fork** `safe-fndn/safe-smart-account` on GitHub. Your contract changes will live on a branch in this fork.

### Day 2–3 — Engage upstream

- [ ] Post a brief comment on [Issue #1065](https://github.com/safe-fndn/safe-smart-account/issues/1065) — something like:
  > "Hi — I'm planning to take a stab at this as part of a university course project. My current sketch: a `BaseTransactionGuard` with a separate `scheduleTransaction(...)` entry-point (since reverting in `checkTransaction` would roll back any state the guard wrote). Would maintainers be open to a PR along these lines? Happy to align on API."
- This earns "Evidence of real interaction with the codebase" (rubric 2.3, up to 5 pts) even if maintainers don't respond before the deadline.

### Day 4–5 — Lock in the design

- [ ] Read the current `DESIGN.md`. Push back on anything you disagree with — it's a starting point, not a contract.
- [ ] Decide:
  - `MIN_DELAY` and `MAX_DELAY` values (suggest: `MIN_DELAY = 30 seconds` for tests/Sepolia, `MAX_DELAY = 30 days`).
  - Whether to also support `IModuleGuard` (recommend: no, scope creep).
  - Whether `cancel` allows cancellers to cancel anything or only their own scheduled txs (recommend: anything — they're trusted).
- [ ] Sketch the `TimelockGuard.sol` skeleton (function signatures + NatSpec, no bodies). Commit it to your fork branch.

### Day 6–7 — Buffer + first benchmark of the existing repo

- [ ] Run `npm run benchmark` once on a clean checkout to know the baseline numbers for `execTransaction` with no guard. Save the output. You'll need this for the "before/after" comparison in the report.
- [ ] Create your project repo's `README.md` with the goal, links to upstream issue, and a "what this is" section.

**Week 1 commit goal:** at least one commit per day in your project repo, even if small.

---

## Week 2 — Implement & test

**Outcome:** A complete `TimelockGuard.sol` with full unit + integration tests passing locally.

### Day 8–9 — Implement the contract

Following `DESIGN.md`:

1. Create `safe-smart-account/contracts/examples/guards/TimelockGuard.sol` on your fork branch.
2. Copy the structure of `OnlyOwnersGuard.sol` for stylistic consistency (SPDX, pragma, imports, `fallback()` pattern).
3. Implement in this order to keep each step testable:
   a. Storage + immutables + constructor (`MIN_DELAY`, `MAX_DELAY`).
   b. Configuration functions (`setUp`, `updateDelay`, `setCanceller`) with `msg.sender == safe` checks.
   c. `scheduleTransaction` — the trickiest piece. Use `ISafe(safe).getTransactionHash(...)` and `ISafe(safe).checkSignatures(address(this), txHash, signatures)`.
   d. `cancel`.
   e. `checkTransaction` and `checkAfterExecution`.
   f. `supportsInterface` (just delegate to `BaseTransactionGuard`).
   g. View functions.

Run `npm run lint:sol` and `npm run fmt:sol` before each commit — the upstream uses solhint + prettier and PRs get auto-rejected on lint failures.

### Day 10–12 — Tests

1. Create `safe-smart-account/test/guards/TimelockGuard.spec.ts`. Use `test/guards/DelegateCallTransactionGuard.spec.ts` as a template — it already shows the `getSafe`, `executeContractCallWithSigners`, fixture pattern you need.
2. Cover every bullet in §4.1 and §4.2 of `DESIGN.md`.
3. Use `time.increase(delay)` from `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers` to fast-forward past the delay in tests.
4. Aim for **>90% line coverage** for `TimelockGuard.sol`. Run `npm run coverage` and screenshot the result for the report.

### Day 13–14 — Hardening

- [ ] Run the full repo test suite (`npm run test`). Your change must not break anything else.
- [ ] Fuzz a few invariants if you have time (e.g. via Foundry — optional, but a strong differentiator for the rubric's "depth and originality" criterion).
- [ ] Add NatSpec to every external function.
- [ ] Update `safe-smart-account/contracts/examples/README.md` to mention the new guard.

**Week 2 commit goal:** 3–5 commits per day during implementation. Small commits per logical step (add storage, add setUp, add tests for setUp, etc.) demonstrate progressive work.

---

## Week 3 — Validate, deploy, document, ship

**Outcome:** Sepolia deployment, gas data, demo video, final report, draft PR.

### Day 15–16 — Sepolia deployment

- [ ] Get Sepolia ETH from a faucet (e.g., https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/).
- [ ] Set `MNEMONIC` and `INFURA_KEY` in `safe-smart-account/.env`.
- [ ] Write a small standalone deploy script (`scripts/deploy-timelock-guard.ts`):
  1. Deploy `TimelockGuard` with `MIN_DELAY=30, MAX_DELAY=30 days`.
  2. Deploy a fresh 1-of-1 `SafeProxy` for testing.
  3. Call `setUp(60)` (60-second delay).
  4. Call `setGuard(timelockGuard)`.
  5. Schedule a tiny test tx (e.g. send 0.0001 ETH to your own address).
  6. Wait ~70 seconds.
  7. Execute it.
  8. Print all transaction hashes.
- [ ] Verify the contract on Sepolia Etherscan (`npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <address> <constructor args>`).
- [ ] Save all tx hashes and Etherscan links in `report/sepolia-evidence.md`.

### Day 17 — Gas benchmarks

- [ ] Add a benchmark file `benchmark/Safe.TimelockGuard.spec.ts` modeled on the existing `Safe.MultiSend.spec.ts` etc.
- [ ] Measure:
  - `scheduleTransaction` cost (one-time per tx)
  - `execTransaction` overhead with vs without TimelockGuard
- [ ] Save results as a Markdown table in `report/gas-results.md`.

### Day 18 — Demo video

5 minutes max. Suggested outline:

1. (30s) Problem — UI attack on Bybit-style multisigs, motivation for delay.
2. (60s) High-level design — schedule, cancel, execute, who can do what.
3. (90s) Code tour — show `TimelockGuard.sol` and one or two key tests.
4. (90s) Live demo — run the Sepolia deploy script, show Etherscan links.
5. (30s) Summary + link to draft PR.

Record with QuickTime or Loom. Upload to YouTube (unlisted is fine) and embed in the project repo's README.

### Day 19 — Final report

10 pages max, PDF or DOCX. **Public GitHub repo URL at the top.** Suggested structure:

1. Introduction — what & why (½ page)
2. Background — Safe Smart Accounts, guards, the Bybit-style attack model (1 page)
3. Methodology — design decisions, why "schedule then execute" pattern, alternatives considered (2–3 pages, lean on `DESIGN.md`)
4. Implementation — code walkthrough with snippets (2 pages)
5. Evaluation — test coverage screenshot, gas benchmark table, Sepolia evidence (2 pages)
6. Discussion — limitations, future work, what would need to happen for upstream merge (1 page)
7. Conclusion (½ page)
8. References — Safe docs, OZ TimelockController, EIP-712, the Bybit incident write-up

### Day 20 — Draft PR

- [ ] On your fork branch, push the final commit.
- [ ] Open a **draft PR** against `safe-fndn/safe-smart-account:main` titled something like:
  > `feat(guards): add TimelockGuard example contract (closes #1065)`
- [ ] PR body: short summary, design highlights, test results, gas numbers, and a link to your demo video.
- [ ] Confirm CLA box in the PR template.
- [ ] Add the PR URL to your project README and the report.

### Day 21 — Buffer / polish

- [ ] Re-read the report top-to-bottom.
- [ ] Verify every README link works.
- [ ] Make sure the **last commit before the deadline is the graded state** (rubric note).
